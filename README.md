# Online-Bookstore-Management-System
Description:
Create a web application that simulates an online bookstore management system. Users should be able to browse books, add them to their cart, make purchases, and manage their accounts.

Features:
User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user registration, login, and logout functionalities. Differentiate between regular users and administrators.
Book Catalog Management: Allow administrators to add, edit, and delete books from the catalog. Include features like searching, sorting, and filtering books.
Shopping Cart: Enable users to add books to their shopping cart, modify quantities, and remove items. The cart should persist across sessions.
Checkout and Payment: Implement a checkout process where users can review their orders, input shipping details, and proceed to payment. Integrate a payment gateway for processing payments.
Order Management: Users should be able to view their order history, track the status of their orders, and cancel pending orders if necessary.
User Profile Management: Allow users to update their personal information, change passwords, and view their purchase history.
Reviews and Ratings: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for books they have purchased. Display average ratings and reviews on book pages.
Security: Implement security measures such as input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), and secure password storage (using techniques like bcrypt hashing).
Logging and Monitoring: Log important events and errors to facilitate debugging and monitoring of the application.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the web application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
Technologies:
Backend: Java (Spring Framework or Spring Boot), Hibernate (for ORM), RESTful API development.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other relational database management system.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize for styling and responsiveness).
Security: Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Payment Gateway Integration: PayPal, Stripe, or any other suitable payment gateway.
Logging: SLF4J and Logback for logging.
Deployment: Docker for containerization, AWS, Heroku, or any other cloud platform for deployment.
